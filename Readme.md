# Presentation
Mono is a VPN-based monitoring system, designed to (passively and actively) capture traffic from mobile device. It is composed of three elements: 
- an OpenVPN client installed on the mobile device (OpenVPN Connect/OpenVPN for Android)
- an OpenVPN server with a public IP address that can capture, decrypt (under certain conditions)
and store packets. It also runs a web server
- a web interface to examine in real-time the traffic of the VPN tunnel.
